Already made a prototype version of the character select. I want to make it that the user picks his character and face a CPU at random.

<h1>Goals</h1>
  -[] Set up the character select that can hold all of the Guilty Gear Strive characters.<br>
  -[] Let a CPU pick a random fighter to face the user.<br>
  -[] Give user results based on choices.<br>
